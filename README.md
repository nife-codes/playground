# Playground 2048

This is an open-source playground project.

Right now, it hosts a simple 2048 game experiment deployed on Vercel.  
The goal of this repository is to serve as a space for small interactive ideas, games, and experiments.

This README is intentionally minimal for now. A more detailed one will be added later.

## Live Demo
